# Information About This Encryption & Decryption Module

### What Does This Code Do?
<br>

This code defines two functions *encrypt_data* and *decrypt_data* that can be used to encrypt and decrypt data using AES-256 encryption
with a given password.
<br>

The *encrypt_data* function takes in two arguments: data and password. The data argument should be the data you want to encrypt,
in the form of a bytes object. The password argument should be the password you want to use to encrypt the data, in the form of a string.
The function generates a random salt and derives a 32-byte key from the password using the PBKDF2 key derivation function. It then creates
an AES cipher object in CBC mode and uses it to encrypt the data. The encrypted data is returned along with the salt and initialization vector (IV).
<br>

The *decrypt_data* function takes in two arguments: encrypted_data and password. The encrypted_data argument should be the encrypted data
you want to decrypt, in the form of a bytes object. The password argument should be the password that was used to encrypt the data,
in the form of a string. The function extracts the salt and IV from the encrypted data and derives the key from the password in the same way
as in the *encrypt_data* function. It then creates an AES cipher object in CBC mode using the derived key and IV and uses it to decrypt the encrypted data.
<br>

In the example code, a random password is generated using the generate_password function (which is not included in your code snippet
but was defined earlier). This password is used to encrypt some sample data (b"Hello World!") using the *encrypt_dat*a function. The encrypted data
is then decrypted using the *decrypt_data* function and the same password.
<br>

You can use these functions to encrypt any data that can be represented as a bytes object. For example, you could use them to encrypt
text, images, or other files. To do this, you would need to read the data into a bytes object, call the *encrypt_data* function with this bytes object
and your chosen password as arguments, and then write the resulting encrypted data to a file or transmit it over a network.
<br>

To decrypt encrypted data, you would need to read it into a bytes object (e.g., by reading it from a file or receiving it over a network),
call the *decrypt_data* function with this bytes object and the correct password as arguments, and then use or store the resulting decrypted data as needed.
<br>
<br>

### Can It Encrypt Both Files and Directories ?

Yes, you can use the *encrypt_data* and *decrypt_data* functions to encrypt and decrypt files. However, you would need to write additional code to read
the contents of the file into a bytes object, call the *encrypt_data* function with this bytes object and your chosen password as arguments,
and then write the resulting encrypted data to a new file.
<br>

This code defines two new functions *encrypt_file* and *decrypt_file* that can be used to encrypt and decrypt files using AES-256 encryption
with a given password. The *encrypt_file* function takes in two arguments: file_path and password. The file_path argument should be the path
to the file you want to encrypt. The password argument should be the password you want to use to encrypt the file. The function reads the contents
of the file into a bytes object, calls the *encrypt_data* function with this bytes object and the password as arguments, and then writes the resulting
encrypted data to a new file with the same name as the original file but with an .enc extension.
<br>

The *decrypt_file* function takes in two arguments: file_path and password. The file_path argument should be the path to the encrypted file you want
to decrypt. The password argument should be the password that was used to encrypt the file. The function reads the contents of the encrypted file
into a bytes object, calls the *decrypt_data* function with this bytes object and the password as arguments, and then writes the resulting decrypted
data to a new file with the same name as the original file but without the .enc extension.
<br>

In this example code, a random password is generated using the generate_password function. This password is used to encrypt a sample file (example.txt)
using the *encrypt_file* function. The encrypted file is then decrypted using the *decrypt_file *function and the same password.
<br>

Note that these functions only work on individual files. If you want to encrypt an entire directory, you would need to write additional code to iterate
over all files in the directory and call these functions on each one.
